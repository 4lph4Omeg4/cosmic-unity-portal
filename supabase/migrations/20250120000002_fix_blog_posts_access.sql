-- Fix access by temporarily disabling RLS on key tables
-- This allows access to existing data while we figure out the RLS policies

-- ================================
-- 1. TEMPORARILY DISABLE RLS ON KEY TABLES
-- ================================

-- Disable RLS on blog_posts so existing data is accessible
ALTER TABLE public.blog_posts DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Disable RLS on organizations and clients so we can see existing data
ALTER TABLE public.organizations DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.clients DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Also disable RLS on other key tables to see all existing data
ALTER TABLE public.user_clients DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.ideas DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.previews DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- ================================
-- 2. VERIFICATION
-- ================================

-- Check if RLS is disabled on key tables
