DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable update for users based on user_id" ON public.profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable delete for users based on user_id" ON public.profiles;

-- Grant all permissions
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON public.profiles TO authenticated;

SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    rowsecurity as rls_enabled
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename = 'profiles';

-- Show current profiles
SELECT 
    p.user_id,
    p.display_name,
    p.created_at,
